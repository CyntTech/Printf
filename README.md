_ printf()
The printf project is a collaboration between  2 people: Linda Chukwu, Cynthia Amaji
Both students in Cohort 6 of ALX Software Engineering track.

This function named "_printf()" imitates the actual "printf()" command located in the stdio.h library of C programming Language. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".

_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. Its prototype is the following:

  int _printf(const char *format, ...)
